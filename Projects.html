    <h3 class="ui header" style="font-weight: 100; margin: 3% 0% 0% 15%; width: 60%; line-height: 30px">In the second semester of 9th Grade, I was given a task with a group, to make a miniature train on a predetermined track on a program called Autodesk Inventor. The train was meant to replace the physical trains that our client, Lionel Train Company, sold. Since this new generation of kids are not interested in physical trains, and only video games and virtual toys, we came up with a train with the theme of Mario's Bullet Bill. Our team came up with this theme, because before we had smartphones and computers, we used to have Gameboys and Nintendo. Eventually, we modeled everything in Autodesk Inventor, and provided Lionel Train Company some other deliverables, including part files, assembly files, presentation files, 13 technical drawings of the toys, the gantt chart, and a presentation. </h3>

The only constraints that were given were the thickness of the key chain, which was 0.25 inches and the area from the top view, which was at the most 6 square inches. I didn't know what to make, but I wanted it to be a little interactive when assembling the parts of the key chain. Then, I created a maze key chain, where one part would have to go through a maze in order to interlock with the other piece. After a few weeks, the parts were laser cut and the finished product met all of the constraints. Below are the images of the individual parts and the final assembled key chain.</h3>

In a group consisting of four students currently taking the Introduction to Engineer Design, we created and modeled a baseball practice machine, called "The Striker". It was designed to create a more efficient way of practicing pitching the baseball. There is a funnel that the pitcher needs to aim in, and there is a curve that shoots the ball back. In addition, there is a statistical board that measures the speed of the ball and the wind speed, to show how much the pitch was affected. The whole model is made with high density plastic and carbon fiber to withstand the ball hitting the Striker.</h3>

In this project, "Tesla" wanted teams of 4 to test different types of power cells in different configurations to learn what the final results would be. My responsibilities in this group was the wiring (circuitry) improving upon the car structure to accommodate the needs of the fuel cells on the car, and taking up about half of the measurements. Responsibilities done as a group included the documentation, calculations, and other team deliverables. The different cell configurations tested include individual solar and hydrogen cells, and 2 solar and 2 hydrogen cells (both circuits wired in parallel). We had an option to choose between series and parallel circuits, but in real world scenarios, series circuits would provide more power, but if there comes a time where one of the cells became deficient, then the whole car would end up not working. Instead, parallel circuits would come in handy. However, due to the constraints of this project, we only we allowed to use up to 2 cells at once. If such a project was upscaled, then the most optimal way to design the car, is to create multiple series circuits all linked together to form one giant parallel circuit. </h3>

For this project, the objective was to build a fully, 100% recyclable, and renewable insulation material that can resist as much heat as possible. The insulation material had a dimension constraint to fit over the heat box, so that the whole insulation material could be heated. This allowed it to heat uniformly without excess material hanging on the side, so that our calculations would be accurate. To do this, our team created an insulation material that consisted of foil paper, cardboard, a cotton cloth, and cotton balls. My responsibilities in the project included building the insulation of the material, organizing the collected data, and calculating the properties of the insulation material including temperature difference, thermal conductivity, resistance value, and the overall energy transfer from one side of the insulation material to the other side.</h3>

    <h3 class="ui header" style="font-weight: 100; margin: 3% 0% 0% 15%; width: 60%; line-height: 30px">In the fall of 2010, a project I worked on in my Digital Electronics class was creating a functional printed circuit board. I was given a task to create any functional and engaging circuit. The circuit that I chose to make was an electronic piano. The intended use of the circuit was to make music similar to how a piano would. The button furthest from the ground of the circuit (the left most button) produces the deepest pitch while the button closest to the circuit’s ground (the right most button) creates the highest pitch. Since this was an individual project, my project responsibilities were not shared. The overview of the design process in which the printed circuit board (PCB) was as follows. I first created a test circuit on a breadboard to make sure that the piano would function properly. I then fabricated the circuit print design using a design software called Fritzing. The next and most time-consuming process was masking and etching, which is the process of printing the Fritzing design onto glossy paper and ironing it onto the circuit board to strip the unnecessary copper that is not part of the circuit. The second to last step was drilling the holes in which the components needed to fit in. The final step was to solder the circuit parts in their respective places. The final product of the circuit is shown below.</h3>
